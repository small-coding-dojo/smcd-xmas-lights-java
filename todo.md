Retro 2022-03-22
- Getting back on track required a lot of time
- Imagining the coordinate system is really hard
- Suggest to draw more - use miro: https://miro.com/app/board/uXjVOFZFerI=/
- Using (0, 0) as left corner is painful
- GitHub is down -> Have a replacement at hand!

Status
- Finished the test `testOverlappingLightToggling()` & Clarify path
- Are we now confident enough to go to the next task?
- Would we go to prod with this thing?

OUR MODE
- Timebox of 5 minutes (option +2 min) -> decide where to go
- First sharing person is the driver - he decides who will be the navigator
- Driver / Navigator (rolling) (in the "mob sense")
  -> Driver becomes next navigator
- Plan 5-10 min of Retro at the end
- AndonCord like behaviour?
  - Do we need discussion or are we on track?
  - every ~21mins (3 drivers) 1-10 above 7 "andon cord" is pulled
- raise vote about continuing/abortion/pausing of kata
  
Next TODOs
- create visible output - create a bitmap?
- Replace for loop by assertArrayEquals?
- Clarify introduce a point
- Disucss about different RSA keys for different remotes
- Find better names for our tests (in the future?)
- Optimize structure of tests 
  - Group by content (on,off,toggle)
    -> Tests für turnOn haben wir angefangen -> LightMatrixTurningOnTest
  - Tests umbenennen -> sauberes Naming erreichen

More other ideas
- Use command / Task with result for getting the light count
- Write a parameterized test that can be used for fuzzing as well
- Später entscheiden: lichter sind außen an -> ausgeschaltete Lichter bleiben nach turn off aus?
