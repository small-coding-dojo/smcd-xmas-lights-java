- After 2022-03-15:
  - Clarify introduce a point
  - Finish the test `testOverlappingLightToggling()` & Clarify path
  - AndonCord like behaviour?
    - Do we need discussion or are we on track?
    - every ~21mins (3 drivers) 1-10 above 7 "andon cord" is pulled
  - Replace for loop by assertArrayEquals?
  - board for next time: https://miro.com/app/board/uXjVOFZFerI=/
  - raise vote about continuing/abortion/pausing of kata
  - change

- FEEDBACK:
  - good, little bit more prep wished
  - wrote more code than a long time
  - flow was there for the most time
  - spontaneous break was good and helped getting on track again


- After 2022-03-10:
  - Timebox of 5 minutes (option +2 min) -> decide where to go
  - First sharing person is the driver - he decides who will be the navigator
  - Driver / Navigator (rolling) (in the "mob sense")
    -> Driver becomes next navigator
  - Plan 5-10 min of Retro at the end
  

Other Ideas
- Find better names for our tests (in the future?)
- Optimize structure of tests 
  - Group by content (on,off,toggle)
    -> Tests für turnOn haben wir angefangen -> LightMatrixTurningOnTest
  - Tests umbenennen -> sauberes Naming erreichen

More other ideas
- Use command / Task with result for getting the light count
- Write a parameterized test that can be used for fuzzing as well
- Später entscheiden: lichter sind außen an -> ausgeschaltete Lichter bleiben nach turn off aus?
